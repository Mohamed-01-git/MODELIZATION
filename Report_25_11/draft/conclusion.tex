\chapter*{CONCLUSION}
In conclusion, this evaluation is based on deterministic and probabilistic scores for both 2-meter temperature and precipitation. The area of study is the MENA region, after we focused on North Africa Especially, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania and Egypt.

 The assessment of 2-meter temperature (T2M) demonstrates exceptional performance across the MENA region, with particularly strong results in North Africa. Models provided by \textbf{ECMWF}, \textbf{METEO-FRANCE}, and \textbf{UKMO} consistently exhibit high accuracy, highlighting their robustness and reliability in capturing temperature variations across a wide range of climatic conditions. This performance underscores their advanced capability to represent both regional and localized thermal dynamics, making them indispensable for accurate temperature predictions in the region.
 
 The precipitation is much more complicated. The scores are moderate for both deterministic and probabilistic scores in all the MENA region. Thus, the analysis per lead-time for precipitation shows an odd characteristic in the SON period with best performance for the second lead-time instead of the other seasons that show the best performance for the first lead-time. Hence, for precipitation \textbf{\textit{ECMWF, MEEO-FRANCE, CMCC-35}} have the best scores.
